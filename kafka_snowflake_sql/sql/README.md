# 🚀 Snowflake Performance Optimization Queries  

This project contains SQL scripts for optimizing query performance in **Snowflake** using **Clustering**, **Materialized Views**, and **Result Caching**. Each script demonstrates how to improve query efficiency and reduce execution time.  

## 📌 1. Clustering (`clustering.sql`)  
Clustering helps optimize query performance by physically organizing table data based on a specific column, reducing scan time for large datasets.  

### ✅ Key Steps:  
- 🔍 Check clustering information on a table.  
- 🛠️ Define a **clustering key** to improve query speed.  
- ⏳ Measure query execution time before and after clustering.  

## 📌 2. Materialized Views (`materialized_views.sql`)  
Materialized views store **precomputed query results**, significantly improving read performance.  

### ✅ Key Steps:  
- 📊 Create a **materialized view** for frequently used queries.  
- ⚡ Run queries to compare performance **with and without** materialized views.  
- 🔄 Refresh and manage materialized views to keep data up to date.  

## 📌 3. Result Caching (`result_caching.sql`)  
Result caching speeds up queries by **reusing previously computed results** when the underlying data has not changed.  

### ✅ Key Steps:  
- ⏳ Run a query to check execution time.  
- ⚡ Execute the **same query** again to leverage **result caching**.  
- 📉 Measure the difference in execution speed.  
- 🗑️ Clear the cache (optional) to test performance impact.  

## 🛠️ Customization Instructions  
- Replace **TABLE_NAME** with your actual table name.  
- Replace **COLUMN_NAME** with relevant column names from your dataset.  
- Modify queries to fit your specific data structure and optimization needs.  

📌 These scripts help analyze and optimize **performance in Snowflake for large datasets**. 🚀 Happy querying!
