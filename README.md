# 🚀 Snowflake SQL Optimization with Kafka  

This project **streams data from Kafka to Snowflake** and provides **SQL optimization techniques** to improve **query performance** using:  
✅ **Clustering**  
✅ **Materialized Views**  
✅ **Result Caching**  

## ⚡ How to Run It  

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies  
First, install the required dependencies:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  

### 2️⃣ Configure Your Credentials  
- Add your **Kafka** and **Snowflake** credentials in the appropriate places.  
- Open `stock_consumer.py` and **update your table name** where data will be inserted.  

### 3️⃣ Start Data Streaming  
Run the **producer** to send data:  
`python stock_producer.py`  
Then, run the **consumer** to receive and insert data into Snowflake:  
`python stock_consumer.py`  

### 4️⃣ Check Logs  
The **logs folder** will capture messages after the consumer starts processing data. Initially, it's empty, but once you run the consumer, logs will be generated.  

## 🛠️ SQL Optimization After Data is Loaded  

### 1️⃣ Navigate to the SQL Folder  
After data is successfully inserted into Snowflake, go to the **SQL folder**:  
`cd sql/`  

### 2️⃣ Use the Optimization Queries  
Copy-paste the queries into Snowflake, replacing:  
- **`TABLE_NAME`** with your actual table name.  
- **`COLUMN_NAME`** with your relevant column names.  

### 3️⃣ SQL Optimization Techniques  

📌 **Clustering (`clustering.sql`)** – Organizes data storage to improve query efficiency.  
📌 **Materialized Views (`materialized_views.sql`)** – Stores precomputed results for faster queries.  
📌 **Result Caching (`result_caching.sql`)** – Reuses query results to boost performance.  

## 🎯 Final Notes  
- **Modify SQL scripts** to match your dataset structure.  
- **Ensure Kafka is running before starting producer & consumer.**  
- **Monitor execution times** to see performance improvements.  

🚀 **Now you’re ready to optimize your Snowflake queries for maximum efficiency!** 🔥  

Happy Querying! 😊🎯
